Reflection

The talk offered valuable insights into how traditional companies can evolve into successful digital enterprises. It highlighted the significance of adaptability, continuous learning, and innovation in creating attractive environments for tech professionals. AirAsiaâ€™s ability to diversify into digital services while retaining its core aviation identity is an inspiring lesson for future technology professionals.

For improvement, I believe better collaboration and communication among teammates could significantly enhance the overall quality of the assignment by ensuring ideas are effectively shared and understood. Additionally, incorporating more creative elements, such as visually appealing designs or unique presentation styles, would make the assignment more engaging and leave a lasting impression.
